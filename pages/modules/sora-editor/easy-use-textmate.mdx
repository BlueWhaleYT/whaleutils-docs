[Sora Editor](https://github.com/Rosemoe/sora-editor) supports TextMate syntax highlighting through `language-textmate` module, while it might take times for developers to write codes to apply textmate themes and languages.

Developers might need:
1. Find available textmate themes and languages
2. Setup all languages and apply into language base, with language configurations set.
3. Write codes provided from the APIs of `language-textmate` module

This might make them feel fatigued. Therefore, this utils here.

<Note>
**More efficent!**

TextMate resources will also be provided once you've imported `sora-editor` module. You can also add additional resources on your own when necessary. More resources will be continuously provided in the future.
</Note>

## Set the language to the editor

Basically, **you have nothing to do** if you use the assets of this module, just set the language to the editor and you're done!

```kt
val textMateUtils = TextMateUtils(this, editor)
textMateUtils.applyLanguage("java")
```
