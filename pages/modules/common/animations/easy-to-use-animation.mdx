We are frastrated to manually create animations through XML `anim/` or programmatically methods. Thus, we created `AnimationUtils` that fasten the efficency and quickly apply an animation to the target views.

---

## Apply animation

See available animations:

<Snippet file="snippet-see-api-docs.mdx" />

```kt
val anim = AnimationUtils(this)
anim.applyAnimation(view, Animations.BOUNCE_IN)
```

### Actions to do after the animation is played

You can set actions when the animation is finished playing, for example:

```kt
anim.applyAnimation(view, Animations.BOUNCE_OUT) {
    // actions to do..
}
```
