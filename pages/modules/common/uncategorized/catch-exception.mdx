Do you feel fraustrated on catching exceptions for some methods that are needed? Normally, you always need them to do so.

<Accordion title="Legacy methods">
#### Use `Throws` annotation

```kt
@Throws(Exception::class.java)
fun method() {
    // ...
}
```

#### Use `try-catch` method
```kt
fun method() {
    try {
        // ...
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
</Accordion>

## Use `catchException()` function!

It's easy to use, when you are in `Activity`:

```kt
catchException {
    // ...
}
```

<Note>
the `tag` if not specified, will use the current Java class name.
