Have you ever thought of a reusable adapter? As its name suggests, reusable adapter means **you are no longer required to write an external adapter class**. Instead, you can quickly start a callback with the adapter to directly bind your views to the `RecyclerView`.

<Snippet file="snippet-desktop-only.mdx" />

---

## Migrate to custom `RecyclerView`

As the `CustomAdapter` only accepts the implementation of `RecyclerView` of this module, you will need to migrate the original one to the target one. Meanwhile, the migration is **SUPER EASY!**

Replace `androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView` with `com.bluewhaleyt.design.widget.recyclerview.RecyclerView`.

```xml
<com.bluewhaleyt.design.widget.recyclerview.RecyclerView
    android:id="@+id/recycler_view"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

---

## Prepare a `data class`

As the purpose of integrating Kotlin or already using Kotlin, we're highly recommended to use `data class` instead of Java's regular getters and setters.

For example, you can design your data class like below:

```kt
data class Person(
    val name: String,
    val age: Int,
    val isMarried: Boolean
)
```

<Note>
If you write the `data class` in Kotlin, you can directly use `setXXX()` and `getXXX()` methods in Java, which will be **automatically generated**.
</Note>

---

## Add data to a `list`

After we finished making a `data class`, we can now create a list and put data into the list, for the purpose of displaying all of them later we do stuff to the `RecyclerView`.

For example, we created three persons.

```kt
val list = mutableListOf<Person>()
list.add(Person("Steve", 34, true))
list.add(Person("Mary", 15, false))
list.add(Person("Heidi", 25, false))
```

---

## Setup a callback

The callback we're going to setup, is essential and important, this is the core controlling and managing the behavior and events of the `RecyclerView`.

### Create a view

<Card icon="circle-xmark" color="#ff4757">
In the past, if we need to create and initialize the view in the adapter, we will need to use these functions:

```kt
override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): ActivityViewHolder
override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int)
```
</Card>

Now, if we come to our `CustomAdapter`, we just need to focus `onCreateView()` function and the `ViewHolder` is provided by default.

```kt
val callback = object : AdapterCallback<Person> {
    override fun onCreateView(itemView: View, data: Person, itemIndex: Int) {
        // handle your views here..
    }
}
```

In addition, you need to specific which XML layout file you want to use, we will talk this later.

<Note>
`itemIndex` means the `position` we used.
</Note>

---

## Setup an adapter

The adapter and its behaviors can be directly written in your current file, for the functions that are available, please look at:

<Snippet file="snippet-see-api-docs.mdx" />

```kt
val adapter = CustomAdapter<Person>(this, recyclerView)
adapter.setCallback(callback)
       .setLayoutView(R.layout.layout_list_item_1)
recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter, list)
```

<Warning>
Please ensure the `RecyclerView` you've imported and used in XML or etc, is provided by this module, not the original one. You will encounter `ClassCastException` if you didn't pay attention to.
</Warning>

## Search and filter the `RecyclerView`

<Card title="Past Practice" icon="link" href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Filterable">
In the past, if we need to implement a search system to filter the `list`, we write them like below:

```kt
override fun getFilter(): Filter {
    return object : Filter() {
        override fun performFiltering(constraint: CharSequence?): FilterResults {
            // ...
        }
        override fun publishResults(constraint: CharSequence?, results: FilterResults?) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```
Also, you need to manually handle the filter actions, which is too fraustrated and fatigued.

</Card>

In light of this, we provided simple functions to implement simple search filtering.

### Adjust the adapter to be filterable

Before implementing the search filtering, you need to set the adapter to be filterable by following code:

```kt
adapter.setFilterable(true)
```

### Prepare a search input

Next, you may need to use some components that are for handling the search inputs. For example, `EditText`, `SearchView` or etc.

In this documentation, we will use `EditText` as the showcase.

#### Filter the list on search

If you want to filter all the fields of the `data class`, you can simply write `adapter.filter(queryText)`.

```kt
editText.addTextChangedListener(object : TextWatcher {
    override fun beforeTextChanged(charSequence: CharSequence, i: Int, i1: Int, i2: Int) {}
    override fun onTextChanged(charSequence: CharSequence, i: Int, i1: Int, i2: Int) {
        adapter.filter(charSequence)
    }
    override fun afterTextChanged(editable: Editable) {}
})
```

#### Filter only specific fields

<Card title="Rollback" icon="rotate-left" href="#prepare-a-data-class">
Rollback to the `data class Person` our formerly made:

```kt
data class Person(
    val name: String,
    val age: Int,
    val isMarried: Boolean,
    val country: String, // add one more field
)
```
</Card>

For example, if you just want to filter with the field `name`, you can do following:

```kt
adapter.filter(charSequence, "name")
```

More fields is also supported:

```kt
adapter.filter(charSequence, "name", "country")
```

#### Highlight the search keywords on the list

First, you will need to get the query text from the input:

```kt
val query = editText.text.toString()
```

Then, go back to the `onCreateView()` of the callback, we can simply highlight by following codes:

```kt
override fun onCreateView(itemView: View, data: Person, itemIndex: Int) {
    val tv1 = itemView.findViewById<TextView>(R.id.tv_text_1)
    tv1.text = data.getName().highlightText(query, Color.RED)
}
```

<RequestExample>
```kt Kotlin
val list = mutableListOf<Person>()
list.add(Person("Steve", 34, true))
list.add(Person("Mary", 15, false))
list.add(Person("Heidi", 25, false))

val callback = object : AdapterCallback<Person> {
    override fun onCreateView(itemView: View, data: Person, itemIndex: Int) {
        val tv1 = itemView.findViewById<TextView>(R.id.tv_text_1)
        val tv2 = itemView.findViewById<TextView>(R.id.tv_text_2)

        tv1.text = data.name
        tv2.text = data.age.toString()
    }
}

val recyclerView = findViewById<RecyclerView>(R.id.recycler_view)
val adapter = CustomAdapter<Person>(this)
adapter.setCallback(callback)
       .setLayoutView(R.layout.layout_list_item_1)
recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter, list)
```

```java Java
ArrayList<Person> list = new ArrayList<Person>;
list.add(new Person("Steve", 34, true))
list.add(new Person("Mary", 15, false))
list.add(new Person("Heidi", 25, false))

AdapterCallback<Person> callback = new AdapterCallback<Person>() {
    @Override
    public void onCreateView(@NonNull View itemView, Person data, int itemIndex) {
        TextView tv1 = itemView.findViewById(R.id.tv_text_1);
        TextView tv2 = itemView.findViewById(R.id.tv_text_2);

        tv1.setText(data.getName());
        tv2.setText(String.valueOf(data.getAge()));
    }
    @Override
    public void onItemClick(@NonNull View itemView, Person data, int itemIndex) {
        // nothing to do
    }
    @Override
    public void onItemLongClick(@NonNull View itemView, Person data, int itemIndex) {
        // nothing to do
    }
};

RecyclerView recyclerView = findViewById(R.id.recycler_view);
CustomAdapter adapter = CustomAdapter<Person>(this);
adapter.setCallback(callback)
       .setLayoutView(R.layout.layout_list_item_1);
recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter, list);
```
